<p><strong>GPOs standardize your organization’s settings.</strong></p>
<p>A <em>GPO</em> is an object that contains one or more policy settings for configuring users or computers. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831791.aspx">Group Policy</a> <em>settings</em> allow administrators to enforce settings by modifying the computer-specific and user-specific settings on domain-based computers. You configure Group Policy settings in GPOs, which you can then link to containers or organizational units that contain users or computers. </p>
<p><strong>GPOs have Computer and User setting.</strong></p>
<p>The Group Policy Management Editor window displays the individual Group Policy settings that are available in a GPO. The window displays the settings in an organized hierarchy that <g>is</g> divided into <strong>Computer Configuration</strong> and <strong>User Configuration</strong> nodes. Settings that are user-centric are in the User Configuration Node. Settings that are computer-centric are in the Computer Configuration Node.</p>
