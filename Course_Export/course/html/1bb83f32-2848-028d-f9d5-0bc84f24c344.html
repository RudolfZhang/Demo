<p>Administrators can <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn789195.aspx">delegate Group Policy administrative tasks</a> to other users. These users do not have to be domain administrators; they can be users that are granted certain rights to GPOs.</p>
<p>For example, different users could be granted different rights to a GPO.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager - Tasked with performing reporting and analysis duties.</li>
<li>Help Desk – Tasked with editing the GPO.</li>
<li>Developers – Tasked with overseeing the creation of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) filters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can delegate the following Group Policy tasks independently.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating GPOs.</li>
<li>Editing GPOs.</li>
<li>Managing Group Policy links for a site, domain, or OU.</li>
<li>Performing Group Policy Modeling analyses on a given domain or OU.</li>
<li>Reading Group Policy Results data for objects in a given domain or OU.</li>
<li>Creating WMI filters in a domain.</li>
</ul>
