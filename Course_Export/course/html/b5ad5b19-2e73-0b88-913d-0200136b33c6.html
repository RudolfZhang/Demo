<p><strong>Universal groups span multiple domains.</strong></p>
<p><em>Universal groups</em> are used primarily in <em>multi-domain networks</em> because they combine the characteristics of both domain-local groups and global groups. Properties of universal groups are propagated to the global catalog, and are made available across the enterprise network on all domain controllers that host the global catalog role. This makes universal groupsâ€™ membership lists more accessible, which is useful in multi-domain scenarios. For example, if a universal group is used for email distribution purposes, the process for determining the membership list typically is quicker in distributed multi-domain networks.</p>
<p>The default <strong>Users</strong> container has several universal groups including <strong>Enterprise Admins</strong>, and <strong>Schema Admins</strong>.</p>
