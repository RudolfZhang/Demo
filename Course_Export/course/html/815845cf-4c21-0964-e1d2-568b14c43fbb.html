<p><strong>Don’t forget local groups.</strong></p>
<p>Local groups are available on stand-alone servers or workstations, on domain member servers that are not domain controllers, or on domain member workstations. Local groups are truly local, which means that they are available only on the computer where they exist. The important characteristics of a local group are:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can assign abilities and permissions on local resources only, meaning on the local computer.</li>
<li>Members can be from anywhere in the AD DS forest.</li>
</ul>
