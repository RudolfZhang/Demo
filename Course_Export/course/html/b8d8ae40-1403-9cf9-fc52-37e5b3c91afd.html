<p>Methods such as Inheritance Blocking and Enforcement can change the effect of GPOs on containers.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance Blocking</strong></p>
<p>You can block inheritance for a domain or organizational unit. Blocking inheritance prevents Group Policy objects (GPOs) that are linked to higher sites, domains, or organizational units from being automatically inherited by the child-level.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>An enforced GPO overrides inheritance blocking. Enforcement prevents a lower-level policy from overriding or superseding policy from a parent site, domain, or organizational unit.</p>
