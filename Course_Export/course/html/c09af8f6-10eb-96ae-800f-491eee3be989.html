<p><strong>It is important to have a strategy for naming your computer accounts.</strong> This will make it easier to manage your accounts. Here are some best practices.</p>
<p>Implement a naming convention that helps you identify the role and location of a computer. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Include an abbreviation on the computer’s role. Such as, SVR (servers), CL (clients), FS (file server), PS (print server), and DTP (desktop).</li>
<li>Include an abbreviation on the computer’s location. Such as, LON (London) and MEL (Melbourne).</li>
<li>Decide on a delimiter, such as hyphen or underscore.</li>
<li>Use a descriptive computer name that has meaning in your organization. Avoid generic names like Client1 and DC1.</li>
<li>Implement the Description property on your computer accounts. Use the property to provide additional security, site, and administrative information.</li>
<li>Avoid including information that can change. Such as, a user name or department position.</li>
</ul>
