<p>Use domain-local groups to manage access to resources or to assign management responsibilities (rights) within the domain. Domain-local groups can include any user in the forest. They can also include users and groups from trusted forests and domains.</p>
<p>The default <strong>Builtin</strong> container at the domain level includes many domain-local groups. Some of the most important are <strong>Account Operators</strong>, <strong>Administrators</strong>, <strong>Backup Operators</strong>, <strong>Print Operators</strong>, and <strong>Server Operators</strong>.</p>
