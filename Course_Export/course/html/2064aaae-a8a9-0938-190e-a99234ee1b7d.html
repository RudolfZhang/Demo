<p><strong>Use global groups to collect similar users.</strong></p>
<p><em>Global groups</em> are primarily used to consolidate users who have similar characteristics. For example, global groups are often used to consolidate users who are part of a department or geographic location. The <strong>Users</strong> container has several interesting global groups including <strong>Domain Admins</strong>, <strong>Domain Computers</strong> and <strong>Domain Users</strong>.</p>
