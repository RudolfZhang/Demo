<p><strong>Using GPO filtering to help find the setting you need.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the nodes contain multiple subfolders that enable you to organize settings even further into logical groupings. Even with this organization, finding the setting that you need might be a daunting task.</p>
<p>To help you locate settings you can filter the entire list of settings in either the Computer or the User section. <strong>Filter Options</strong> include: <strong>Managed</strong>, <strong>Configured</strong>, <strong>Commented</strong>, and <strong>Keyword</strong>. You can also combine multiple criteria. For example, you could filter to find all the configured settings that apply to Internet ExplorerÂ 10 by using the keyword ActiveX.</p>
