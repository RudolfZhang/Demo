        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p />
        <p>&lt;b&gt;Account lockout threshold&lt;/b&gt;. The Account lockout threshold setting determines the number of failed logon tries that are allowed before a user account is locked out. Set this value high enough to allow for mistyped passwords, but low enough to minimize the chances of a successful brute force attack on a password.  </p>
