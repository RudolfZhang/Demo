1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
In this demonstration we'll look at a

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,100
common administrator task managing

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000
password policies now password policies

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,849
are defined through group management so

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,190
let's begin in Server Manager under the

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,220
Tools menu selecting Group Policy

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,970
Management and then we're going to edit

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,060
the default domain policy for Adatum.com

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,080
in the group policy management

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,420
editor the settings that we're looking

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,759
for are under computer configuration

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,340
policies windows settings security

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,620
settings and then under security

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,590
settings account policies and there are

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,030
two policies we're going to look at

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,850
password policy and account lockout

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,620
policy

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
let's begin with the password policy

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,140
settings you can specify when a user can

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,000
reuse a password from their password

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,480
history you can set the number of days a

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,309
password can be used before the user

23
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,769
must change it and you can set the

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,299
minimum number of characters the

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,030
password must contain there are also

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,909
password complexity requirements and if

27
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:12,840
you're not sure what a particular

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,479
setting is just open the setting and the

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,220
explain tab will provide some additional

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,460
information in this case the password

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,439
cannot contain the user's account name

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,570
or parts of the users full name

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,590
also important are the account lockout

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,980
policies the account lockout threshold

35
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,900
determines the number of failed login

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,170
attempts before a user is locked out the

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,390
default value of zero indicates a user

38
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,130
will never be locked out

39
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,110
you want to set this value high enough

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,810
to allow for mistyped passwords but low

41
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,730
enough to protect against brute force

42
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,870
attempts to guess the password these

43
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,490
global settings are applied to the

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,770
domain but what if you would like a

45
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,500
particular group to have a different set

46
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,620
of password settings to do this will

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,660
return to server manager the tools menu

48
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,970
and select the active directory

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,560
administrative center now in the global

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,510
search text box I'll type in password

51
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,920
settings

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,640
this is a nice administrator trick

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,530
what's returned is the password settings

54
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,400
container and on the right I can then

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,740
set up a new set of password settings

56
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,190
now these settings should look familiar

57
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,459
but what's different is on the bottom

58
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,480
right I can add a group or groups for

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,780
this particular set of settings so I can

60
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,420
specify these settings are for my domain

61
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,010
admins and then I can require my domain

62
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,150
admins to have a longer password I can

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,460
shorten the password history

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,290
and I can make them change their

65
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,880
password more often after adding a name

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,340
and a precedence I will have a set of

67
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,910
settings just for my domain admins these

68
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,860
types of passwords are often referred to

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,370
as fine-grained passwords your course

70
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,500
has several labs on password management

71
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,570
please take a few minutes to try them.
