00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Voiceover] When using
the word, computer,

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,003
in the context of this training course,

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,008
I'm referring to the entire package

4
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,008
of everything you need to
actually accomplish tasks.

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,003
So people refer to a computer as just

6
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,005
the actual unit housing
the main components

7
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:14,005
of the hard drive,
processor, memory and so on.

8
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,007
But to use a computer, you also need

9
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,001
a monitor, so you can
see what you're doing.

10
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,007
Some computers like notebook computers

11
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,006
or all-in-one computers
have built-in monitors

12
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,008
but it's important to
not confuse the monitor

13
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,003
with the computer itself.

14
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,001
The monitor is also called the display

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,002
and it's doesn't do any
of the work or processing.

16
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:32,005
It simply displays the
computer's interface

17
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,001
which is still an essential component

18
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,007
of the entire system.

19
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,000
You also need a keyboard and a mouse

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,003
so you can enter text and commands

21
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:39,008
and control the computer.

22
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:41,004
You often need speakers or headphones

23
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,005
so you can hear the sounds
your computer makes.

24
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,002
Some computers have built-in speakers

25
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,004
while others don't.

26
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,003
Computers also need to
have an operating system,

27
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,008
which is the software that manages

28
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,001
the operation of the entire system.

29
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,008
We'll talk more about operating
systems a little bit later.

30
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,009
And to use a computer you'll

31
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,009
also need applications,
which are the programs

32
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,006
that run on your computer
like word processsing,

33
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:03,003
spreadsheet or photo editing applications.

34
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:05,002
Many computers come with built-in software

35
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,009
and you can purchase and install thousands

36
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:10,001
of other software applications
you might want or need.

37
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,004
You may also need additional hardware

38
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,004
to have your computer perform other tasks.

39
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,009
For example, you'll need a printer,

40
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,006
in order to have paper
copies of your documents.

41
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:19,002
Or a scanner to create electronic versions

42
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,000
of your paper documents.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,003
These days, your printer and scanner, may,

44
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,000
in fact, be the same device though.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,003
And if you want to get online,

46
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,001
you'll also need Web-browsing software,

47
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,008
a modem and to subscribe
to an Internet service

48
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:32,002
if you want to get on the
Web with your computer.

49
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,004
So, at the very least, you need the

50
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,008
computer unit itself, a monitor,

51
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,005
an operating system and the keyboard

52
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,008
and mouse to have a computer system.

53
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:41,003
But all of these things and more make up

54
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,008
your computer system and generally,

55
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,005
when we talk about computers,

56
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:46,001
we're talking about any configuration

57
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,007
that involves these basic
and essential components.
