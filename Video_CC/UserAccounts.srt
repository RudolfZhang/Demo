1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
This demonstration will look at a common

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,620
administrator task create user account

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,420
and will start in server manager under

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,490
the Tools menu with the active directory

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,080
administrative center in the ADAC just

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,059
right-click the domain of interest then

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,270
select new and user every user in your

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,430
domain must have a user account and you

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,680
should never let users share accounts

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,289
now in the create user page there is only two

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,349
pieces of information that are required

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,380
full name and login name the full name

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,329
is a combination of first name and last

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,390
name for the login information you want

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,219
to make sure if you have a large number

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,770
of users that it's easily recognizable

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,649
and it is unique and then every user who

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:44,969
logs in the first time will need a

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,489
password so you can provide a password

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,070
for the user on the right-hand side make

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,620
sure user must change password at next

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,320
login is selected and if this was a

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,059
temporary hire you can also specify

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,250
the hours they could login or the

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,460
computers they can log on to there's a

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,379
lot of other information about your user

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,659
you can provide on the organization tab

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,880
and the more information you provide the

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,659
better

30
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,119
there's the office that they work in

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,380
their email address their job title

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,020
the department that they work in there's

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,479
a lot of contact information and if you

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,520
have a large number of users that share

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
the same attributes you definitely want

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
to consider using a user template that

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
you can create each user from user

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,630
templates are covered in your course

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,899
materials now if you prefer you can use

40
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:39,840
the ADAC history to show you the

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,720
PowerShell commands the first one is

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,270
New-ADUser this is where you set all

43
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,349
the attributes for the user and then

44
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,619
you'll use Set-ADAccountPassword

45
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,390
to give the user that initial password

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,929
and the third command you need is

47
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,409
Enable-ADAccount so whether you use the a

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,659
deck or Powershell that's all you need

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,560
to create a user.
