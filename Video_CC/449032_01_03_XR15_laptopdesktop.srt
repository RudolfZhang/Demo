00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,001
- [Voiceover] When it comes time

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,006
to pick out and purchase a computer,

3
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,003
one of the first decisions
you'll have to make

4
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,004
is whether you want to
get a desktop computer,

5
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:09,003
a laptop computer or
even a tablet computer.

6
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,006
Here's an example of a laptop computer.

7
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:14,008
Laptop computers are also often
called notebook computers.

8
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:17,000
These computers are
designed for portability,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,004
often weighing less
than four or five pounds

10
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:20,008
and they have the monitor, keyboard

11
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,007
and mouse pointing device built in

12
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:24,009
so you usually don't have
to plug in other accessories

13
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,002
to use the computer.

14
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,009
And these are examples
of desktop computers.

15
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,002
Now, the term desktop can mean

16
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:32,003
different things when you're
talking about computers

17
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,007
but in this context, desktop refers to

18
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,000
all computers that
either sit on or next to

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,008
your desk or work station.

20
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,009
The computer itself does not have a

21
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,008
built-in monitor, keyboard or mouse

22
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,007
but the keyboard and
mouse are usually included

23
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,005
in the same box the computer ships in

24
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,000
and the have to be
plugged in to the computer

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,002
when you set it up.

26
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,007
And desktop computers are not designed

27
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,001
to be portable or carried around a lot.

28
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,000
But how do you decide which
type of computer to get?

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,006
Well for the most part,
you should only select

30
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,009
a laptop if you genuinely
need the portability.

31
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,006
Laptops today are nearly
if not just as powerful

32
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,002
as their deskptop counterparts,

33
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,007
but you'll usually be
spending more money on laptops

34
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,000
for the same amount of power

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,008
you can get from a desktop computer.

36
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:11,004
Desktop computers also have the advantage

37
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,009
of being more upgradable.

38
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, laptops have USB ports
for adding external hard drives

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but desktop computers usually have

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,003
more available USB
ports and they also have

41
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,001
slots for expansion cards or for

42
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:25,002
additional internal hard
drives or optical drives.

43
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,007
Desktops are usually easier
to upgrade yourself too.

44
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,006
Also if your computer is
mainly going to be used

45
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:32,000
in your home or office and you
don't need the portability,

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you can treat yourself
to a much larger monitor

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,008
than you would get on the laptop.

48
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:39,002
Laptop displays generally
top out around 17 inches

49
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:40,008
but these days you can purchase montitors

50
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:44,007
at 23, 27 or even 30
inch and larger sizes.

51
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,004
Of course many laptops offer the ability

52
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,006
to connect to additional
monitors these days too,

53
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,003
but you're still going to be paying more,

54
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,002
so unless you really need the portability,

55
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,002
you'll want to stick with the desktop model.

56
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,009
Now you've probably heard
of a third type of computer

57
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,004
called a tablet computer.

58
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,006
Devices like Apple iPads
and Android tablets

59
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,004
fall under this category.

60
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,009
They come with touch screen displays

61
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,005
and you operate them
by touching and tapping

62
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,001
the screen with your fingers.

63
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,001
However, I wouldn't recommend the iPad

64
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,004
or an Android device
as your only computer.

65
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,001
They're not nearly as powerful or capable

66
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,008
of doing professional work, and they run

67
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,004
a different operating system than is found

68
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,004
on desktop and notebook computers.

69
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,001
However, if you're interested in a tablet

70
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,008
but also want the power and capability

71
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,006
of a desktop operating system,

72
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,003
another category of computer to consider

73
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:25,009
is the hybrid computer.

74
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,002
This includes computers like the

75
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:28,009
Microsoft Surface Pro 4,

76
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,003
which is a touch screen tablet

77
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,004
that runs the same version of

78
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,001
the Windows operating system found on

79
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,008
desktop and notebook computers.

80
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,007
So you can operate it
with just your fingers,

81
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:38,003
or you can attach a keyboard to it

82
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,000
to make it more like a notebook computer.

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,004
But just like with a notebook computer

84
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,007
if you don't need the portability,

85
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:43,007
you'll probably want to consider

86
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,001
getting a desktop computer.

87
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,004
And again, while tablet computers are

88
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,002
great devices to have, and you can do

89
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,005
all kinds of work on them from

90
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,005
word processing to video editing,

91
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,003
at this point for most people

92
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:54,002
I don't think they're suitable

93
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,006
to be the only computer in
your office or household

94
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,009
and throughout the rest of the course,

95
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll be working on the assumption

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,004
that you either have a desktop

97
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:02,004
or a notebook computer.
