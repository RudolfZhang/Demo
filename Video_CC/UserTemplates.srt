1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
In this demonstration we will use a user

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,819
template to create a new user and we'll

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,859
start in Server Manager under the Tools

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,620
menu with the Active Directory Users and

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,920
Computers tool now in the sales

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,320
organizational unit we've already

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,500
created a template and most employees

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,480
start with an underscore so that they

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,220
appear at the top of the list and they are

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,220
easily recognizable now if we look at

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,349
the properties on this template then we

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,849
can see some things have already been

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,470
filled out for us

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,120
for example the description the office

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,640
on the organization tab we have the

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,970
Department sales the company Adatum and

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,290
the manager Adam Hobbs and on the member

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,750
of tab you can see we've added this

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,410
member to the sales group to save time

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,390
you want to fill out as many attributes

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,820
as you can now to create a user from our

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,280
template simply right-click the template

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,150
and select copy

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,530
in the copy object page that comes up

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,140
you'll provide the user a name including

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,340
a user login name

27
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,229
the user will also need a password

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,030
and that's it

29
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,270
now if we take a look at our new user we

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,799
can see some things have already been

31
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,040
filled out for us under account the city

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,150
information is there

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,960
under organization we see Department

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,070
company name of the manager and this

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,689
person is a member of the sales group

36
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:02,390
remember some things are not copied your

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,759
organization may need multiple templates

38
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,100
but using templates will not only save

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,959
you time it will ensure that the

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,700
attributes for each user are consistently entered.
