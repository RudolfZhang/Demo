1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,270
In this demonstration we will look at

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,809
creating and nesting groups when it

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,340
comes to implementing group management

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,670
in the domain you need a strategy begin

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,650
by identifying the different identities

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,500
in the organization like sales managers

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,110
and auditors next collect those

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,690
identities into global groups based on

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,760
the members role for example a sales

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,369
global group and an auditors global

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,369
group now when you need to provide

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,129
access the domain resources consolidate

13
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:34,260
the global groups into a domain local

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,079
group for example you can add the sales

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,079
and auditors global groups into a single

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
domain local group called sales and

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,289
auditors lastly assign your domain local

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,079
group to the resources for example a

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,659
folder and then create permissions on

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,350
that resource this best practice for

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,120
nesting groups is known by the acronym

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,039
IGDLA let's look at how to implement

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,830
this practice here in Server Manager

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
under the Tools menu lets select the

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,360
Active Directory Administrative Center

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,420
and in the ADAC we can right-click the

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,310
domain and select new group now the

28
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,020
first group that we will create is

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,270
called auditors and it will be a

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,210
security group and the group scope will

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,400
be global now global groups are

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,740
primarily used to consolidate users who

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,140
have similar characteristics like

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,620
auditors

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,040
let's add another group this group will

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,730
be called sales and auditors and this

37
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,680
will be a security group and the group

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,340
scope will be domain local now let's add

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,740
for the members tab the sales group and

40
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,960
the auditors group we now have a group

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,430
that we could assign to protected

42
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,860
documents on a shared network resource

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,900
so you want to use domain local groups

44
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,230
to manage access to resources or to

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,670
assign management rights

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,780
now if you prefer you can use the

47
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,940
Windows PowerShell History to see the

48
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,150
commands that you could use for example

49
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,610
the New-ADGroup would create a

50
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,580
group scope of global for the auditors

51
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,800
group and then the second group we

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,990
created the group scope is domain local

53
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,240
and that's for your sales and auditors

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,900
group and then Set-ADGroup can be

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,720
used to add members to a group like we

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
did with the sales and auditor groups

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,910
your course does have labs on managing

58
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,190
group accounts so be sure to take a few

59
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,270
minutes and give those a try.
