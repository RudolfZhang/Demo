1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
In this demonstration we will look at

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,299
configuring Group Policy preferences

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,760
now we'll start in Server Manager under

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,040
the Tools menu with Group Policy

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,000
management and within group policy

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,910
management we will expand the forest and

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,039
the domain and then edit the Default

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,349
Domain Policy for adatam.com now in the

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,119
Group Policy Management Editor both

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,250
Computer Configuration and User

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,309
Configuration have Preferences and

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,079
within Preferences there are Windows

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,480
Settings and Control Panel Settings

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,700
let's take a look at some of the things

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,050
you can do with the Windows Setting

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,020
Preferences you can map a network share

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,870
or folder you can limit registry

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,989
options or settings you can create a

19
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,660
shortcut to the desktop file system or

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,289
URL and you can create a folder or set

21
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,449
of nested folders and that's what we'll

22
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,390
do we'll go over to Windows Settings and

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,670
on Folders right-click and select New

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,659
Folder and on the drop-down on this page

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,850
we're going to select as our action

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,150
Create and this will be a folder on the

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,909
c drive for the Research group we could

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,740
do something fancier but we'll keep it

29
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,520
simple

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,890
now on the Common tab it's important to

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,420
remember that preferences are always

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,640
reapplied but there is an option to

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,790
change that one thing that unique about

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,880
Preferences is Item Level Targeting item

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,860
level targeting lets you specify exactly

36
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,640
where to apply the preference so you can

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
apply it to particular computers or an

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,570
IP address range an organizational unit

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,020
a user you can even specify the

40
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,970
operating system that you want to apply

41
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,250
this to now we're going to keep it

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,170
simple and choose the Research

43
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,810
organizational unit but know that you

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,180
can combine different criteria to target

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,509
a very specific set of items once the

46
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,850
preference is created we apply our

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,479
changes and then click OK make sure the

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,569
preferences were created and then

49
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,400
if we want to push these changes out we

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
can use GPupdate  / force just

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,980
like you do with group policy and it'll

52
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,599
just take a minute or so before it

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,389
reports back that this is completed

54
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,650
successfully

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,420
once that happens we're ready to test so

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,639
I'll switch over to the client computer

57
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,989
and I'll log in as Rose Rose is a member

58
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,959
of the Research group so after she's

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,209
logged in we should be able to navigate

60
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,000
to the c drive and there should be a

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
research folder that has been created in

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,010
summary your preferences are different

63
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,650
from policies they are not enforced and

64
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,650
they provide item level targeting now

65
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,569
your course does have a lab on Group

66
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,150
Policy preferences so please take a few

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,349
minutes to give it a try.
