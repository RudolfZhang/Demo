1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
In this demonstration we will

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,859
troubleshoot broken computer connections

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,519
usually a client will establish a secure

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,309
channel to the domain controller and

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,110
authenticate to the domain

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,389
however sometimes the computer cannot

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,550
establish a connection and this is

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,520
referred to as a broken channel there are

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,289
number of reasons this can occur perhaps

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,029
you recently installed the operating

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,010
system and the security ids are different

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,890
or maybe the computer has been inactive

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,990
for a long period of time or the account

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,340
has been reset

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,710
either way the account exists and the

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,660
client cannot authenticate to the domain

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,750
the symptoms of a broken channel are

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,690
very clear here we have Meghan who is

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,000
reported to the help desk that when she

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,160
tries to login she gets an error message

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,010
the trust relationship between this

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,960
workstation and the primary domain

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,610
failed once you recognize you have a

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,100
broken channel you'll want to log into

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,530
the computer as the domain administrator

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,040
and then under system properties you

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,170
want to change the computer from the

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,810
domain to a temporary work group and you

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,460
will need the local administrator

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,689
account to get back on

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,520
once you're welcomed to the temporary

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,100
work group you'll be prompted to restart

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,010
the computer after the machine restarts

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,350
you'll need to login as the local admin

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,620
because you're not on the domain and

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,980
then return to system properties and

37
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,220
change from the workgroup back to the

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,850
domain and you will need administrator

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,520
credentials to get onto the network and

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,170
you'll also need to restart the machine

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,550
after the computer restarts Meghan will

42
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,040
be able to join the domain and you'll be

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,290
able to close the ticket so remember

44
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,210
when you have a broken channel remove

45
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,369
the computer from the domain and then

46
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,800
rejoin it and your course does have a

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,050
lab on this so please take a few minutes

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,100
to give it a try.
