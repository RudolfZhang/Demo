## User password policies

![Visual representation of the three ways to secure your user accounts: Password Policies, Account Lockout Policies, and Fine-grained Password Policies. ](../..\Linked_Image_Files\1.2.1.png)

In any authentication-based network, it's important to secure account credentials such as user names and passwords. In this topic, we will cover three ways to protect user account information.

*   **Password Policies.** Enable you to configure multiple requirements, such as password age, length, and complexity.
*   **Account Lockout Policies.** Enable you to configure when to lock an account when the wrong password is entered too many times.
*   **Fine-grained Password Policies.** Let you specify different password policies and account lockout policies for different groups of users. For example, executives, administrators, service accounts, or regular users.
